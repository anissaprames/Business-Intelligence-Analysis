# Business-Intelligence-Analysis
This repository contains files Business Intelligence Analytics from a private course by Abeam Consulting x ITB using python. The files included in this repository had already been permitted by the course authority to be uploaded, while the dataset being used in this repository is exclusive to participant of the course.
The purpose of this repository is to give an example or overview in doing Multivariate Analysis using Machine Learning, in this case Decision Tree Classification. Therefore, there are two files which one using entropy while the other one using gini coefficient.

It consists of data cleaning, organizing, univariate, and bivariate analysis

## File Description
- To run the files I am using Google Collab a notebook that allows you to execute code via browser
- The **Business Intelligence Analysis using gini coefficient.ipynb** encoded with data from bank transaction with its attribute.
- The **Decision Tree using Entropy.ipynb** encoded with smaller dataset of transaction history.




### Notes: One of the file was my own execution for a final group project. I decided not to upload the group work without the other member's consent and uploaded my work instead.

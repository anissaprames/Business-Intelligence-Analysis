# Multivariate Analysis using Decision Tree (Gini coefficient) for Customer Segmentation
This repository contains files from a private course by ABeam Consulting x ITB. The files included in this repository had already been permitted by the course authority to be uploaded, while the dataset being used in this repository is exclusive to participants of the course.
The purpose of this repository is to show the steps in doing Multivariate Analysis using Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation, in this case Decision Tree Classification. Therefore, there are two files, one using entropy while the other one using gini coefficient.


It consists of data cleaning, organizing, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis with gini coefficient.

## File Description
- To run the files I am using Google Collab a notebook that allows you to execute code via browser
- The **Business Intelligence Analysis using gini coefficient.ipynb** file is my own execution for the final group project in the class as I decided not to upload the group work without the other member's consent. This file encoded with data from bank transactions record and its attribute.

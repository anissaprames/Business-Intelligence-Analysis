# Multivariate Analysis using Decision Tree (Gini coefficient) for Improving DM Response

This repository contains files from a private course by ABeam Consulting x ITB. The files included in this repository had already been permitted by the course authority to be uploaded, while the dataset being used in this repository is exclusive to participants of the course.
The purpose of this repository is to show the steps in using Machine Learning for Improving DM Response, in this case a Supervised one, which is Decision Tree Classification.

It consists of data cleaning, organizing, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis with gini coefficient.

## File Description
- To run the files I am using Google Collab a notebook that allows you to execute code via browser
- The **Business Intelligence Analysis using gini coefficient.ipynb** file is my own execution for the final group project in the class as I decided not to upload the group work without the other member's consent. This file encoded with data from bank transactions record and its attribute.

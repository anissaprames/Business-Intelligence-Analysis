# Improving DM Response

This repository contains files from a private course by ABeam Consulting x ITB. The files included in this repository had already been permitted by the course authority to be uploaded, while the dataset being used in this repository is exclusive to participants of the course.
The purpose of this repository is to show the steps in using Machine Learning for Improving DM Response, in this case a Supervised one, which is Decision Tree Classification.

It consists of data cleaning, organizing, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis with gini coefficient.

## File Description
